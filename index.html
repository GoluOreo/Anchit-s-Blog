            Niagara Falls is located near Lake Erie and the city of Buffalo. From far away, you can see the mist gliding in the wind. As you get closer to the river, you can hear the pristine river's rushing water.
             As you get into Niagara Falls State Park, the caws and squaks of rowdy seagulls fill the air with noise while small nestlings huddle and waddle to their next stop. 
             After getting to know the place, you should try Cave of the Winds. You have to buy tickets for Cave of the Winds. On this exciting ride, you go to a wooden deck where boisterous splatter, continous gusts, and mist of the Bridal Veil and American falls give you a long-lasting thrill for a memory that you can cherish forever. No need to worry. You do get a poncho. 
             Another ticket the national park sells is Maid of the Mist. A pleasent cruise ride in the beaming sun, right? Not anymore. As you get closer to the Horseshoe Falls, the boat starts to rocks. Mist surrounds you from all sides. Yes, you do get a poncho for this ride too. The winds blow your hoodie back so much that you have too hold. It's like when you're playing a survival game, but in real life. No one dies, falls offboard, or drowns. I hope I made that clear enough. Water and mist splash your face. There's a point where you can barely open your eyes. That's beauty of Mother Nature and Niagara Falls. You start heading back, and the fun you wants you to go again. Whether you do or you don't, Niagara Falls is a lifetime experience.
             Niagara Falls has an interesting history. This wide green landscape wasn't that lush at all. It used to be full of factories that polluted the water and the air until someone started a movement to remove the factories. During the Great Depression, many people found jobs here in Niagara Falls. They were paid to demolish factories and buildings.
             Do you know Nikola Tesla? He invented a electricity generator using the water's power right here! This was the first hydroelectric power plants. It's one of the biggest of its time, and still is today! Quite fascinating, isn't it?
            After your adventure, you might want to get some ice cream. Be aware! They give two giant scoops of ice cream, twice as big as your cup. However, they give a variety of exotic tasty flavors.
            Everyone's tired after a long day. Before you go, you should see Terapin Point, which gives a broad view of the Horshoe Falls.
            Don't leave the park just yet! Take a break by going on the trolley ride. View the beautiful scenery while your smile widens on your face.
            As you leave, you might want to take a souveneir, keychain, or magnet from any of the gift shops. You can keep this in your home, so you can remember this amazing journey to a place that is nature's wonder, Niagara Falls.

 <p class="text-muted">I wasn't quite sure how the movie would be like, after seeing a dog and a penguin. Natural coincedince?
  I started playing the movie and saw a mischevious dog always up to something. 
  The local judge ruled that Oddball had one more chance until his punishment, whatever that would be.
The penguins on a nearby island are getting protected by sanctuary, but the sanctuary will be closed if there are less than ten penguins on the island.
It turns out that the mischevious troublemaker named Oddball saved the day. Good to watch with family and kids, this movie for you to watch too!
